<h1>Hello, long and prosperous life!🖖</h1>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
  i'm 18 years old, i'm a computer technician who graduated from <b>IFRN - campus Santa Cruz/RN</b>. I really enjoy web development, it's currently the area I'm studying, focussing on full-stack development. Among my projects in this area is a portal made with the PHP language and the laravel framework, which aimed to help educate people with specific needs at the IFRN.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently focused on learning more about the technologies used in the market to improve my skills and become an increasingly better professional.
